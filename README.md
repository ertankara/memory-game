## How To Play

Each card is totally anonymous until user clicks it. Once user clicks the card, the card will flip and reveal its icon. Then user can select another card.

If the two selected matches, it means you found a pair. User can win the game once you find all the pairs.

If you fail to match the cards, open cards will hide their icons again and user should try to remember that cards icon and once user finds the pair of that card, user should click it again to match them.


### Higher Scores

User can have higher scores depending on the number of moves they've made to match all pairs.
Less moves, higher the scores.
